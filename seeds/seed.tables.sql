bag with a round tip. Line two baking sheets with
parchment paper. On a third sheet of parchment paper,
trace out 24 1.5-inch circles (use a round cookie cutter
or stencil as a guide), spaced 1 inch apart. Set aside as
a master guide.', 1),

until finely ground. Use a fine mesh sieve or sifter to
sift strawberry-almond flour mixture and powdered sugar
together twice; use a firm spatula to push any large
particles through. Set aside.', 1),

fitted with wire whip attachment. Whip for 3 minutes on
medium speed (4 on a KitchenAid), until egg whites begin
to foam. Increase speed to medium-high (7 on a KitchenAid)
and whip for 3 minutes, until meringue forms soft peaks.
Increase speed to 8 and whip for another 3 minutes. Turn
off mixer and add gel food coloring; whip another 1 to 2
minutes on high speed to evenly distribute color until
meringue is stiff and dry. The meringue should clump in
the center of the wire whip attachment; knock against

spatula to fold dry mixture into meringue, smearing the
mixture against the side of the bowl to knock the air out

folding them gently). After 25 folds, your mixture may
still look lumpy. Continue to fold about 10 to 12 more
times, checking texture after each fold. The batter is
ready when it holds its shape when spooned onto itself and
slowly flattens out after 15 to 20 seconds. If the batter
is stiff and does not flatten out, it is undermixed. If the
batter is runny and fluid, it is overmixed and will not hold a
shape.', 1),

of circles between baking sheet and parchment paper. Hold
piping bag vertically and pipe batter to within 1/8 inch from
the edge of the circle. Carefully remove master guide from

sheet, repeating with remaining batter. Remove guide and

90 degrees and tap two more times (to deflate air bubbles
and prevent cracked shells).', 1),

fluffy. Reduce speed to low; gradually add powdered sugar
1/3 cup at a time and beat just until smooth.', 1),
